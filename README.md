Contact pschichtel on github.com if you want to maintain this project.

Unmaintained
------------
As I stopped using MusicBee as part of my migration away from Windows, I stopped using this plugin myself and thus also stopped maintaining this. There is however an updated version by [@mbfrankz](https://github.com/mbfrankz) that can be found [over here](https://github.com/mbfrankz/LyricsReloaded).
